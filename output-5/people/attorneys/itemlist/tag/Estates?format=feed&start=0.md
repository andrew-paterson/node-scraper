### Overview

In planning your estate, you exercise the right to take advantage of the one opportunity to do as you please, with no questions asked. We assist in anticipating and arranging for the organised disposal of your assets upon your death.

We therefore assist in drafting wills, and compiling the relevant documentation to be kept with your will. It is important to keep copies of documents with your will, as this greatly assists the executor when he attends to wind up your estate.

As we understand that heirs and family members are usually seized with funeral preparation and the like, we aim to lift the burden and attend to the formalities of the deceased estate for you.

Our Associates work together with our Anona Morris, who is exceptionally skilled and experienced in dealing with, and winding up, late estates, as well as testamentary and _inter vivos_ trusts.
