In both residential and commercial properties, when a tenant leases property the landlord is obliged to give undisturbed, vacant possession and occupation of the premises. In turn, the tenant is obliged to pay his/her rentals timeously. The relationship between the parties is governed by a lease agreement which can either be in writing or oral, but it is highly recommend that such lease agreement should be in writing.

Regarding commercial properties in the event that the tenant does not honour the agreement (a typical example is non-payment of rental) in terms of the common law the landlord can apply for a Warrant of Ejectment and if granted by the Court, the Sheriff would evict the tenant.

In residential properties, however, eviction procedures are governed by what is known as the Prevention of Illegal Evictions and Unlawful Occupation Act (PIE) and the procedure is unfortunately rather cumbersome. It is always better to first try speaking with the tenant and enquire as to when they are able to voluntarily vacate the premises, as well as come to a settlement with regard to payment of the arrear rental. If that fails, and as a last resort, eviction proceedings in terms of PIE should be instituted and this should be done with the assistance of your attorney. These proceedings can be very lengthy as well as costly and costs are higher if done at the High Court.

Before granting an order for eviction, Judges and Magistrates have a duty to first look at the personal circumstances of the tenant. They query whether the tenant has alternative accommodation; whether there are minor children or disabled individuals occupying the premises; as well as whether the house is headed by a woman. If these factors are present, courts are not inclined to grant the order immediately and therefore the tenant would be given some time to vacate the premises. Obviously the landlord is prejudiced by this as, during the time the tenant is in occupation, it is unlikely that he will be receiving any rental income from the property.

Accordingly, it is always advisable to first screen any potential tenant thoroughly, as a landlord, before agreeing to enter into a lease agreement with such tenant. There are tenants that are habitual rent defaulters and move from premises to premises without paying any rental. Screening clients can be done by carrying out various credit and judgment checks, which you can instruct your attorney or estate agent to attend.

However, if you are faced with a situation where you want to evict a tenant it is best to consult your attorney. It is crucially important that you never take the law into your hands by locking out the tenant and/or cutting the water and/or electricity supply as they can bring spoliation proceedings against you. This is a court application whereby the tenant seeks to be re-possessed of the property, regardless of whether their occupation of same is lawful, as they were unlawfully dispossessed of the premises which was in their possession. In the event that such order is granted, you may even be liable for the tenantâ€™s legal costs.
