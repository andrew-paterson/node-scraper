There are two types of Trusts which are dependant on when and how they are established.

### A Will Trust

This type of Trust is established in terms of your Last Will and Testament and comes into effect after your death upon the winding up of your Estate by your Executor.  Generally speaking, the object of a Will Trust is to provide for minor children until they attain an age where you believe they are able to responsibly manage their inheritance.

### The Inter Vivos Trust

This Trust is established “inter vivos” i.e. “during your lifetime”.  Broadly the objects of an inter vivos Trust would be firstly, estate planning i.e. transferring your assets to the Trust during your lifetime, so that upon your death your Estate would not attract Estate Duty; and/or provide for beneficiaries (including future generations) upon your death.  Secondly, protection of assets; as a Trust is a juristic person separate and apart from you.  In pursuing this objective “the devil is in the detail” and specific advice and planning is essential to successfully achieve this objective.

A Trust is established by the Donor or Founder, who donates (usually) a sum of money to the Trustees, for the benefit of others, the beneficiaries.

The Trustees are responsible for the administration of the Trust fund (their duties are governed by the Trust Property Control Act and the Common Law) for the benefit of the beneficiaries.  It can be said that it is more important to appoint the correct persons to act as Trustees, than to try and govern in terms of the wording of the Trust Deed.

A Trust can play a very important role in the structuring of your affairs and providing benefit, for both family members and others, in a structured manner and upon terms and conditions which you would stipulate.  However Trusts have attracted a lot of attention and commentary and specific advice, based on your personal circumstances and objectives is essential in determining whether you should establish a Trust of not, or whether a Trust is appropriate to your needs.
