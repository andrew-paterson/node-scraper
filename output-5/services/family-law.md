We understand that this area of law requires a great deal of sensitivity and care. Our professional staff provides the necessary emotional support and attention according to each clientâ€™s needs.

In providing this service, we attend to negotiations and settlement, including drafting the relevant agreements, including a Parenting Plan, where applicable.
