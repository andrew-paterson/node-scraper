PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE - Join the Upper Highway and Westville community at a FREE talk by Johann Von Bargen (JVB) on Pro-Active Crime Prevention.

ENOUGH is ENOUGH - We want every member of our community to be equipped with the knowledge of how to prevent and behave in a risky or dangerous situation.

This in not the time to be complacent - See you on the 16th Feb at 7 pm - Westville Boys High School - Hall.
