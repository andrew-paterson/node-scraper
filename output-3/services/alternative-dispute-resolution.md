### Overview

Our firm is an active supporter of alternative dispute resolution procedures, as we know that it is highly effective, and often results in a substantial reduction in costs as are usually associated with court litigation.

The mediation option provides an informal setting in which the parties can discuss the issues, guided by a mediator who is appointed on the understanding that he is an expert in the relevant area of law.

The arbitration proceedings are more formal, and are conducted much the same as a trial, except that it is far more cost-effective and swift. It further allows the parties to choose the arbitrator, thereby ensuring a beneficial outcome.
