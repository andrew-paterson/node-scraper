Thanks to National Wills Week which took place during the week of 12 – 16 Sept 2016, we are all reminded that having an up-to-date will is considered one of the most crucial things we can do to protect our assets, spouse and children when we are no longer around to do so. Besides the protection of assets and loved ones, a will ensures that once we have passed on, your estate is handled in the manner we would like it to be and our final wishes are granted.

Aside from the obvious reasons why one should have an updated will, here are some others you should keep in mind:

YOU’VE WORKED HARD FOR YOUR MONEY: Most of us have had to work hard to build our assets and accumulate our possessions. Yes you may have been one of the lucky few who was the beneficiary of a small fortune but the vast majority of us have had to sweat and toil for what we have. And so it would be unfortunate to see your hard earned assets fall into the wrong hands or even worse, squandered.

IT’S YOUR FREE WILL TO CHOOSE: There could be those who are legally entitled to your estate and often there are others who just have a sense of entitlement, believing you owe them. They may fight for what they believe is rightfully theirs when you have no control. The control is entirely in your hands – should you want to disinherit someone, who ordinarily could lay claim to your assets - the choice is yours but without a will in place, your assets could fall into the hands of someone you deem undesirable.

YOU ARE STILL A TAXPAYER: You may be gone but unfortunately you still owe taxes on your estate. It is therefore important to distribute your assets and wealth in the most tax-efficient way possible. For example the value of what you give away to family members, loved ones or charity will reduce the value of your estate when it’s time to pay estate taxes.

YOU CAN HAVE THE FINAL SAY: Let’s face it we don’t often get the chance in life to really get the last word in, so make the most of this opportunity. Here’s your chance to ensure that what you really want is expedited exactly as you have asked. You get to have the final word!

SOMEONE YOU CAN TRUST: Executors play the biggest role in the administration of your estate, so it is advisable to appoint someone honest, trustworthy and organized. Remember that if you choose a friend or family member; when the time comes, they probably will need to appoint someone professional and experienced to assist them anyway; because the business of winding up an estate is not a simple exercise - so choose wisely.

YOUR LIFE IS EVER CHANGING: Your life is made up of a continuous flow of events and changes, such as birth, death, partnership, divorce and much more. As these events influence and shape your life, it’s comforting to know that you can update and change your will whenever you please and as often as you wish.

MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHERE IT MATTERS: Your final wishes can also reflect your personal values and interests. Formulating your last will and testament is an opportunity to give to others (individuals or organisations) who may not be in line to inherit from your estate but who you wish to help and impact positively – leaving a legacy where it truly matters.

It seems that the reluctance to accept death as part of life often leads many to endlessly procrastinate when it comes to drafting a will. Thus the realisation that a will is necessary comes too late or never at all. The added stress this places on families at an already emotional time, is challenging and often debilitating. For these reasons it is advisable to take control and contact an estate planning attorney to assist you with this all-important necessity.

So to sum it up - where there’s a will, there’s definitely a way……….to leave a legacy.
