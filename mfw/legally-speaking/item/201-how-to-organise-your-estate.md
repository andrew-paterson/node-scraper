It is prudent to take measures to organise your estate, whilst you are alive, in order to ensure that the person appointed to administer your estate after your death may do so effectively. This person is referred to as an executor/executrix and such person has various duties and responsibilities which are codified in law.

The starting point in the organisation of your estate is execution of a valid will. Without a valid will in place, your estate will devolve according to the Law of Intestate Succession. This does not mean that your assets (and liabilities) will be distributed randomly; rather, they will devolve upon persons such as your spouse, descendants and ascendants in a manner regulated by law.

It is, however, first prize to execute a valid will and to disclose the finer details of your last wishes therein. It is advisable to contact an attorney to ensure that your will is drafted and executed in compliance with the requirements of validity.

As efficient an administrator you may regard yourself, you will not be around to administer your estate. A succession plan must be developed involving key individuals and the collation of various supporting documents.Â  As death is inherently traumatic for a family, by following simple guidelines the task of the executor can be made far more convenient, and less stressful for the family.

The primary role of an executor is to gather the assets and liabilities of your estate, submit a liquidation and distribution account to the Master of the Court and, after approval thereof, to distribute your estate amongst your heirs.

The following list is a guideline of supporting documents which may be kept with your will:-

1.  Identity document;
2.  Name and address of employer, and salary number if applicable;
3.  Details of pension fund/retirement annuity;
4.  Income tax details, including details of accountant;
5.  Name, address and telephone number of usual doctor;
6.  Partnership agreement and names and addresses of partners, if applicable;
7.  Particulars of close corporation or private company, if applicable;
8.  Details of divorced and/or predeceased spouses;
9.  Ante-nuptial contracts, divorce agreements, maintenance agreements;
10.  Title deeds for fixed property;
11.  Rates and taxes accounts and/or details of Body Corporate/Managing Agents;
12.  Registration certificates in respect of motor vehicles;
13.  Details of firearms;
14.  Certificates/details in respect of Timeshare;
15.  Share certificates (stock exchange);
16.  Hire and letting contracts, e.g. items bought on hire-purpose;
17.  Investment statements, details of credit and chequing accounts;
18.  Details of short-term insurance (house, vehicle etc.);
19.  Accounts owing by deceased; and
20.  Copies of ID documents/birth certificates and marriage details of beneficiaries.

The above list is not exhaustive and the documentation required will differ from estate to estate. A very helpful strategy is to make two or three copies of the bundle of your estate documentation and distribute these amongst key individuals, such as your attorney, your spouse and other trusted family members. An attorney will be able to advise you on the various issues which you will need to consider when organising your estate. The framework of law which governs testate and intestate succession is complex and should not be underestimated. There are far too many instances where estates, which could have been seamlessly administered, have taken years to finalise. This places an unnecessary burden on your family and is a situation which is completely avoidable with careful planning.
