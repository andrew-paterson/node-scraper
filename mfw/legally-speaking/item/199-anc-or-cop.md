Marriage is a wonderful institution that brings security and happiness to many couples and families. Most people, however, are not aware of the consequences a marriage can have on one’s assets, responsibilities and duties as a spouse.

This aspect of the law is governed by both the common law, and the Matrimonial Property Act, 88 of 1984 (the MPA) and provides for three possible matrimonial property regimes:

*   In community of profit and loss
*   Out of community of profit and loss, with the exclusion of the accrual system
*   Out of community of profit and loss including the accrual system.

The common law is a term used to describe the law as it has developed over time, and which has not been codified into a statute, yet remains the authority on legal issues.

In terms of South African law, if you get married without signing a contract (known as an ante-nuptial contract), you will then be married in community of property. This is the default system in our country, and it is therefore imperative that you are aware of the other options available.

Should you not wish to be married in community of property, the MPA provides for parties to be married out of community of property, with the option of applying the accrual system.

Firstly, it is important to note that a marriage is dissolved by one of two ways:

*   by the death of one spouse; or
*   by divorce.

Should you choose this option, it means that once you are married, your estate and your spouse’s separate estate are combined. You will both own all assets in the combined estate. Importantly though, it also means that you will both be liable for each other’s debts, and the assets of the entire estate are at risk to creditors throughout the marriage. Thus you enjoy community of profit, but also community of loss.

Once the marriage is over, the estate is split with each spouse receiving half of the total value. Should either or both spouses be liable for debt in any respect, then these debts are paid first, with the balance to be split between the spouses. This could mean that if you have kept up to date with your financial commitments, but for some reason your spouse has not, the wealth you have accumulated will be subject to valid claims from creditors for payment of outstanding debts due by your spouse. Therefore this regime may not be suitable for marriages in which one spouse is unable to limit their personal liability due to the nature of their profession (e.g. attorneys cannot limit their liability and remain personally liable for the debts of their practice should it fail). Many couples prefer this regime however and indeed, many couples choose this regime as it accords with their cultural beliefs.

Section 2 of the MPA states that every marriage entered into out of community of profit and loss shall be subject to the accrual system, unless it is expressly excluded by the ante-nuptial contract.

In order to be married out of community of property, it is necessary to conclude an ante-nuptial contract (ANC). This is a simple document which records the parties’ intentions as to the manner in which their assets will be dealt with during and on dissolution of the marriage. It must be signed by both spouses and notarised by a Notary Public before the date of the marriage in order to be valid, whereafter it is lodged at the Deed’s Office for registration. The law allows for an ANC to be lodged within three months of the date of the wedding.

There are two options available in this regime: with accrual or without accrual.

If one opts out of the accrual system, then once the marriage is over, the assets of each party remain their own. This is so, as the spouses have expressly directed that they will not share each other’s assets once the marriage is over. This also means that the spouses will not be liable for each other’s debts, during and after the marriage. Thus, should one spouse be sequestrated, for example, the other spouse’s assets will not form part of the insolvent estate and will be protected from creditors.

Many marriages, however, are not so simply constructed, and the law has become alive to this fact. In many cases, one spouse pursues a career and ends up amassing a very large and valuable estate. The other spouse is usually tasked with attending to the family and the home. Whilst this is a vital role in any marriage or family, it does not manifest tangible value necessary for calculating the value of an estate. Thus, if the parties were married by way of ANC, the spouse who did not have a salaried job will be left with next to nothing once the marriage is dissolved.

In order to equitably redress this situation, the law introduced the accrual system and specifically provided that it would apply to a marriage concluded by way of ANC unless expressly excluded. Further, the parties are required to declare the value of their estates at the commencement of the marriage, for the purposes of calculating accrual.

If the accrual system applies, then each separate estate is valued and calculated as follows:

*   The value of the smaller estate is subtracted from the value of the greater estate
*   The difference between the two is then halved, and this amount is added to the smaller estate.
*   Essentially, it allows for a redistribution of the assets whereby the lesser estate gains 50% of the difference between the two estates.

It is important to note that when calculating the value of each estate, if the commencement value of an estate is given as a monetary figure, then one is required to apply the CPI Index to this amount, so that it may be calculated in real terms.
