Uh-oh. There is someone at your door, with documents in their hand and a grim look on their face.

“Are you Jane White, and do you live here?” It’s the Sheriff – you have been served!

It is never a pleasant experience being served with a summons; it usually means that you’re in trouble right? Well, do not panic, as there is a simple and easy way to get through the ordeal.

Firstly, make sure that the person serving the summons on you is actually a **Sheriff** or **Deputy Sheriff** of the court. You are entitled to ask the Sheriff to produce proof of his identity and holding of his position; this is usually done by the Sheriff producing his badge. It is important to note here that the only person authorised to serve a summons is the Sheriff, and if he does not provide proof, you are entitled to refuse to accept the document. Furthermore, the Sheriff is required by the rules of court to explain the nature and importance of the document he is serving on you. If this is not done, you are entitled to ask the Sheriff to explain the consequences of being served with a summons.

Once you have the document, the most vital thing to do is to **read** it. Read the entire document. Read every word. Read it again. There is actually a lot of information in the summons that can help you, depending on what is being claimed against you and your ability to answer the claim. Even if you have an attorney who attends to all your legal matters on your behalf – read the summons! It will place you at a great advantage knowing exactly what your rights are and how to enforce them.

Ok, so now you have read the summons. You will note that the first requirement is to notify the person who is bringing the claim against you (i.e. the plaintiff) that you are defending the matter. This is critical; if you do not attend to this timeously, the plaintiff will then be able to take default judgment against you, without giving any notice to you. This can easily be avoided by entering an appearance to defend, and ensuring not only that it is **served on the plaintiff**, or his attorneys, but that it is also **filed at the court** out of which the summons was issued. You will further note that you are required to give notice of your defence within ten business days of receiving the summons, so it is imperative that the notice is delivered without delay.

We obviously strongly suggest that you contact an attorney should you be served with a summons, but it is important that you are aware of your basic rights and that you know how to implement them, should this be your only option at the time of receiving the summons.
