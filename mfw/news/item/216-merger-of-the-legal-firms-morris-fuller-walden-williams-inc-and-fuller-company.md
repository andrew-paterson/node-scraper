Morris and Mike have together been practising in the Highway area for a combined period of 70 years.

Morris Fuller started practicing in Pinetown in 1973 and established Morris Fuller & Associates on 01 March 1986.

In February 1992 Mike Williams merged his practice Hayward Williams of Westville with Morris Fuller & Associates.

At this time Morris Fuller left the practice to pursue his property development interests.

In 1997 Morris Fuller started Fuller & Company and practised from Westville.

Morris Fuller & Associates practised out of Pinetown and moved to Westville at the end of 2004 and practised as Morris Fuller Walden Williams Inc.

Not only have Morris and Mike been in the highway area for many years the younger members of the firm also have strong highway roots.  Craig Laidlaw grew up in Kloof and went to Kearsney, Lesley Hall (formerly de Vries) in Pinetown and matriculated at Pinetown Girls High and Jason McDonald is a Westville Boys High Old Boy – as was Morris Fuller.
