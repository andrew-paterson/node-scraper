### Soilixia® – next generation chemistry to help farmers feed a changing planet.

Soilixia® is a revolutionary Soil Activator using next generation chemistry to effectively address compaction, sodicity and salinity in agricultural soils. Soilixia® is completely biodegradable and especially beneficial in exhausted soils.

Traditional farming methods can be hard on agricultural land. Improving quality and yields in marginal or exhausted soils has been the challenge for African farmers for decades. The need to manage the build-up of salts, increasingly alkaline top soils resulting from over-fertilisation, and soil compaction have until now seemed impossible to overcome.

This is where revolutionary chemistry solutions offer a fresh start for farmers in regions where land is marginal or has been declared unusable. Soilixia® is opening abandoned fields and new opportunities for our continent’s farmers.

Where salt build-up in soils has previously ruined crops and the land itself, Soilixia® brings relief and improved yields to all crops in a variety of conditions including soil compaction, sodicity and salinity. Key areas of improvement include:

**Germination** – pre-dosage improves seed germination, rendering up to 100% success. Seedlings are larger and more robust.

**Root development** – hair root mass is improved and nutrient uptake increased.

**Growth** – produces a healthier plant overall with more resilient structure.

**Yield** – better nutrient release in soil leads to greater yields with higher sucrose or starch levels in fruit.

**Water infiltration** – salt management through chemistry improves reticulation and plant uptake.

Unbelievable benefits have been seen in our test station plantings with a variety of common crops in Southern African soils. We have documented improvements in the following crops:

**Maize** – is noticeably stronger with marked improvement in early growth, stand yield per hectare.

**Citrus and Olives** – earlier flowering produces a better yield, while robust plant structure means less leaf-stress and better chlorophyll levels.

**Grapes** – show more robust plants and better yields in younger vines.

**Bananas** – produce larger hands with improved weight.

**Cotton** – a marked increase in bolls per plant and boll size.

**Melons and Cucumbers** – show greater tendril development and more seeds in the fruit.

### **So how does Soilixia® work?**

Soilixia® interferes in the binding of PO<sup>4</sup> (phosphate) with Ca (calcium) ions making the phosphates and other nutrients available to the plant long after application.

By making more of the nutrients present in the soil available to the plant, Soilixia® produces healthier, stronger and more disease-resistant crops.

In saline or sodic soils, Soilixia® reduces salinity and alkalinity.  In certain cases it lowers or removes the need for Gypsum.

Improved soil porosity, reduced bulk density and less soil compaction means there is less Nitrogen loss overall. Fewer chemicals and fertilisers are needed.

Soilixia® even improves the performance of weedicides, herbicides and other fumigants.

Because it manages salt build-up – what is often refer to as ‘scale’- Soilixia® also keeps irrigation lines and emitters deposit-free.
