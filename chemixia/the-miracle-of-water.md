How often do people consider water? Certainly, it’s top-of-mind when there’s a shortage or a crisis. But how often do we actually think about it? What is it? What is it made of?

At Chemixia, it’s just about the only thing we think about. We think about water treatment, it’s purity, where it travels and how. We’ve been dealing with water in all its forms and looking at how it changes and adapts with each element it comes into contact with.

This short piece on water from the BBC really made us think. It’s our most important natural resource and we still know so little about it. We’ve learned how vital it is to always be curious, stay informed and understand our world in new ways.
