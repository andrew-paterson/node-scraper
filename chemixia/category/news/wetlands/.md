<figcaption>As a country, as a planet, with critical shortages looming we can no longer afford to just discard our waste water into the nearest waterway or ocean.</figcaption>

**According to a News 24 article dated January 29, 2019, Government is being more than a little shy about releasing the results of its latest wastewater audit.**

We all know that a water crisis is looming. Cape Town narrowly averted Day Zero last year through a combination of radical citizen participation and natural intervention: It rained.

Many lesson were learned in Cape Town and the country as a whole. First, we can no longer ignore the growing demands of a growing population on a limited natural resource. Second, need to conserve and reuse water wherever possible if we are going to avoid massive supply disruptions.

One of the major areas in which we lose potable water is in the waste water cycle. This is true of municipal water piped into private homes and used for flushing and washing. It also pertains to water used in industry. Wastewater must be treated before we dump it into our precious waterways and oceans. Further, we need to reclaim as much of it as possible for use in municipal systems.

A good starting point here would be for municipalities and local authorities to set up rigorous maintenance schedules and appoint teams to manage critical elements of waste water reticulation and disposal.

The News 24 article, focused on a particular region makes some good general points nonetheless.
