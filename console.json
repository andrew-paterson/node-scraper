I completed a Bachelor of Journalism at Rhodes University, and have been self-employed for the past seven years. \n\nDocumentary photography and reportage will always be my first love, and its influence is clear in my work. When I arrived in Cape Town I was a padawan photography assistant for food photographer extraordinaire [Russel Wasserfall](http://www.rwasserfall.co.za/), who took me under his wing.\n\nI adore natural light, and strive to make the most of light that I'm given. When I shoot personal projects, I prefer shooting on film. Whether it's interiors or architecte; a wedding or a portrait, I aim to create images that are honest and beautiful, taken intuitively and simply. \n\nI'm currently studying digital curation at the University of Cape Town in the hope of merging my skills in this exciting new field where art and technology collide."

Friends of the couple travelled from across the world to be at the ceremony, and guests took off their shoes and started dancing on the lawns before the meal has even ended.

        "full_text": "Lesley and David are one of those couples that make even the most hardened cynic’s heart get a little warm and fuzzy. They celebrated their wedding on their seventh anniversary, surrounded by happy family and friends.\n\nLynda, Lesley’s aunt, was the officiator of the non-religious ceremony, and her words captured Lesley and David’s relationship wonderfully. Helped by Mr Shakespeare’s sonnet, ‘Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediment’, it was a lovely service.\n\nIt turns out that winter in Kwa-Zulu Natal is not actually Winter at all. The weather was absolutely beautiful, and played its part perfectly for the sunny outdoor wedding on David’s family’s sugar cane farm.\n\nLesley was simply beautiful. I’ve been searching for the right phrase to describe how exquisite she looked, but I don’t think that the words actually exist. As she walked down the garden aisle to Bob Dylan’s ‘Make me Feel your Love’, sung by friend Lizzie, everything was just right. Royal blue and yellow were the colours of the day – sunflowers and shweshwe were perfectly joyful.\n\nLesley’s mother, Penny’s words were powerful and eloquent (as always) and Best Man Paddy had everyone in hysterics. David, however, made it impossible for any man to ever live up to the new standard set for wedding speeches. When he broke out in song (Lou Reed’s ‘Take a Walk on the Wild Side’), accompanied by musician friends in the audience, I think every guest there, including Lesley, was lost for words.\n\nPerhaps it was the full moon, but I think that it was the infectious happiness overflowing that made Lesley and David’s wedding so special. Dancing and merry-making continued long into the clear Zululand night, and I don’t think that any of us guests will remember that day without an enormous smile.\n\nPostscript. bridesmaid and photographer duties were tricky to juggle, but I’m grateful to [Adrian Jennings](http://www.ady-jennings-photography.com) and some delicious Steenberg 1682 MCC, who made it manageable and incredibly fun.",

        "full_text": "People thought I was saying “Honey Guy” when I was working on the Honey Guide story about Mark Farah. It’s quite fitting actually. Mark is The Honey Guy. He loves what he does. It glows in his eyes when he speaks.\n\nChatting about his bees and the honey they make for him, Mark brings his mountain apiaries into the trading hall of the Neighbourgoods Market. In doing this, he typifies what the market does so elegantly, drawing the city and it’s surrounds together into a feast for the senses. You can’t necessarily see the hives - or trout dams, pastures, olive groves, ovens, stone mills of the vendors -but they are there in spirit.\n\nI wanted to see that spirit world made flesh, and asked if I could spend some time creating a little photo essay with Mark at one of his mountain sites. On the day, we were joined near Constantia Nek by market manager Ben Cox. Ben gets pollen from Honeyguide every Saturday, and just as curious as I about the provenance of Mark’s fabulous raw honey, jumped at the chance to see the man at work.\n\nPreparing his equipment in the clearing below the hives, Mark is unhurried but meticulous, patient and attentive. He readies everything for our walk up to the bees where we are transported into his world of buzzing alchemy.   \n\nMark gently scoops up a handful of bees as he prises the lid off a hive. They flow down his arm before he flicks them to the ground. There the mass evanesces and resolves into a roiling, humming cloud.\n\nA bee hatches as we watch. A perfect, delicate creature wriggles its way out of an alveolus, slightly shaky at first. She takes her first few hesitant steps, then she’s being fussed over by nearby bees. Soon she is indistinguishable from her countless peers. Not to Honey Guy. He points out the old bees, the hungry ones and the angry ones. ‘That guy’s just checking you out, he’s investigating’, he reassures me as my nose becomes a point of orbit.\n\nBees have personalities, and colonies have moods. Mark knows his bees, and he senses subtle fluctuations. ‘Hear that?’, he asks as the buzzing near a hive crescendos. ‘They’re getting a little worried’.\n\nIt doesn’t seem right to call Mark’s processes ‘simple’, although when he explains what he does it just makes sense. To understand colonies, work with hives, ensure that your bees are healthy, and collect honey without upsetting a natural balance is no small feat.\n\nEthical farming isn’t straightforward when it comes to bees, and bad practice isn’t as obvious as with large mammals. This is mostly because we don’t understand bees. Mark seems to, though. Bees get manipulated, taken advantage of, and produce honey of an inferior quality, all in the name of lowering costs and increasing yield. Ersatz honey, the stuff we find on supermarket shelves, is made by bees who forage from Eucalyptus or fruit orchards, and whose foraging is engineered and controlled. The bees are manipulated, and the resulting honey is one-dimensional.\n\nThe honey, propolis and pollen that Mark collects from his indigenous bees is completely different. His management techniques are eco-sensitive, and his bees forage in uncontaminated environments around the Cape. Mark produces and sells raw, unprocessed honey, beeswax, propolis and pollen under his Honeyguide label. It is one of few brands that sells pollen, which is a little-recognised, complete superfood.\n\nThere’s a wonderful tale by Roald Dahl called Royal Jelly, a whimsical warning to parents, where a baby is fed too much propolis and begins morphing into a bee-creature. I don’t reckon that Ben will sprout wings anytime soon, but deep down, I wouldn’t be surprised if Roald Dahl was onto something, and the Honey Guy knows it. There’s real magic in bees.",
