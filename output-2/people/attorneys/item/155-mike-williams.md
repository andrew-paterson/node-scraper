Mike completed his BA degree at the University of Cape Town in 1979 and his LLB degree at the University of Natal in 1981\. After completing his articles and practicing as a professional assistant with Allaway Shepstone for two years he purchased the Westville practice of TD Hayward in 1987, and changed the name to Hayward Williams. Due to the growth of Hayward Williams it became necessary for him to expand his practice and merged with Morris Fuller & Associates with effect from 1st March 1992, creating Morris Fuller Walden Williams.

Mike is one of our two Directors, and leads the firm with inspiration and determination.
