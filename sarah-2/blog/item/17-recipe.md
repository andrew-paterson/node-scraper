If at all possible, we prefer to cook steaks with a bone in. This adds to the flavour of the meat, but also gives you a convenient handle to tackle the delicate bits with. Meat should always be cooked from room temperature, and seasoned about half an hour or so before you cook it.

2 rib-eye steaks on the bone (250-300g each)  
salt and pepper  
120 ml olive oil  
herb brush with sage, rosemary, thyme  
1 lemon, halved

SAUCE  
60 ml butter  
1 small onion, thinly sliced  
125 ml button mushrooms, sliced  
250 ml beef stock  
60 ml whisky  
60 ml pouring cream  
30 ml lemon juice  
15 ml thyme, finely chopped  
salt and pepper

Melt the butter in a pan over medium to high heat. Saut√© the onions for 4-5 minutes until opaque, then add the mushrooms and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the beef  
stock and whiskey bringing it to a simmer before stirring through the cream, lemon juice and thyme. Return to a simmer so it reduces and thickens. Season to taste and set aside.  
We prefer to cook steak on a braai or live flame for best results, but you can cook it in a very hot pan. Again, a grill pan is better than a flat pan, but you need to cook your steak the way you like it. A tip here is to cover the pan with a lid after the initial charring on both sides if you like a more medium to well-done steak. Rest the steak 5 minutes before serving with the reheated sauce.
