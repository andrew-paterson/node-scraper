Making your own patties gives you control over what goes into your burger. It all starts with the meat which should be a ratio of 75% meat to 25% fat. Why? Because fat equals flavour.

600 g minced beef

Half a red onion, finely chopped

15 ml Worcestershire sauce

1 egg

salt and pepper

Cook the onion slowly in a little butter until opaque. If you brown them, especially quickly over a high heat, their bitterness will be evident in the burger. Set aside to cool before use.

Place the beef mince, onion and egg in a large bowl and season well with salt and pepper. Now, this is the messy bit – get your hands in there and mix until well combined.

Divide into four equal portions and shape into four patties 2 to 3cm thick. They should be about 190 to 200g each. Pop them on a plate, cover with cling-film and put them in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up.

As always, we like to cook our meat on a live flame – even burgers. The charred, smoky flavour is fantastic. A very hot grill pan will do the trick just fine though. Depending on how you prefer to eat your burgers, the cooking time will range from 3 to 5 minutes per side. You often see people pressing down on patties as they cook, thinking this is a good idea. It’s not. You press out all the fat and end up with a dry burger, leaving part of the flavour in the pan or in the fire.

Split some buns. Get out the lettuce, pickles and a nice, sharp, mature cheese and assemble the burger of your dreams. We don’t think a good quality beef burger with pickle and cheese needs any sauce, but by all means…
