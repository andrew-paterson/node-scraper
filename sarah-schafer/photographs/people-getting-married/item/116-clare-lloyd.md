Clare and Lloyd had their wedding on a rainy winter weekend, but nobody seemed bothered by the weather. Clare is from Ireland, and has been working in Cape Town for a few years, which is how she met Lloyd. They share a love of the city, dancing, laughing, and each other. their wedding day was filled with happy family and friends, laughing and dancing (so much dancing!).

The reception took place at the quirky blue bird garage in Muizenberg - with great food and fantastic music, it was the perfect place to end the day off.
