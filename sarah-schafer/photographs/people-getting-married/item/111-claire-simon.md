When Claire contacted me to photograph her wedding in Zambia, I jumped at the chance. Her family owns a lodge right on the border of the South Luangwa National Park, and guests arrived from across the world to spend some time at Marula Lodge, catch up with Simon and Claire, get to know each other, and have a holiday in the Waterhouse's own slice of heaven.

With hippos munching in the garden at night, elephants destroying the flower arrangements, a hot Zambian (mid-Winter!) sun and a fantastic array of people, Claire and Simon's wedding was extraordinary. They suit each other effortlessly, and the amazing crowd of people who travelled across the world to be with them for their marriage was a real testament to their love.
