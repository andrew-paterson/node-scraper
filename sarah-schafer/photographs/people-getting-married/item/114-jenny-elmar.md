The beautiful wedding of Jenny and Elmar took place at the wonderful restaurant and wedding venue, the Table at De Meye (the restaurant has since changed to Overgaauw Restaurant). The setting was simply idyllic - gorgeous fragrant roses adorning every surface, happy guests and incredible food.

I had photographed the pair previously, and it's always wonderful working with such a relaxed couple. They live in Bonn in Germany, but decided to have their wedding in South Africa, where Jenny's mother Beate lives.

It was a small wedding party, less than 50 people, which was lovely and intimate. Friends of the couple travelled from across the world to be at the ceremony, and guests took off their shoes and started dancing on the lawns before the meal has even ended. Surrounded by vineyards, Camilla's amazing food, happy people and a flawless late Summer's evening, it was an absolutely wonderful day.
