The tiny little town of Botrivier set the scene perfectly for Karen and Pete's beautiful wedding. The charming Beaumont wine farm was the perfect place, with it's historic water mill, fantastic wines and spectacular views of the Overberg mountains.

Karen's exquisite vintage beaded dress, found by her sister Sara on her travels, was topped off with a feather headpiece that belonged to her grandmother, and the bride was simply gorgeous. Fresh herbs as confetti, a group of fabulous friends, delicious food and an abundance of love were the order of the day. and just like their bottles of bubbly were labelled, it was a day of ridiculous happiness.
