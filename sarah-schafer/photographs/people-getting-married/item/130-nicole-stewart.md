I spent a lot of my childhood on Nicole's family farm, Thornkloof. It's just outside of Grahamstown, and is the epitome of raw Eastern Cape beauty. She and Stew live in Zimbabwe but came back for her wedding. Her mom made her dress from her German gradmother's lace tablecloth! It was a beautiful day, made more special by old friends.
