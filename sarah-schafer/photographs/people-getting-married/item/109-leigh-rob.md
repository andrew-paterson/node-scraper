Leigh and Robert Cobban tied the knot with an intimate wedding in Observatory, Cape Town. The ceremony took place in Leigh's sister, Gaby's house in Obs, and was small and authentic. Sans church, the wedding was refreshingly different.

It was happy and relaxed, with champagne popping in the outside courtyard all afternoon until the group went to enjoy a proper Cape Town night at the Brass Bell in Kalk Bay.
