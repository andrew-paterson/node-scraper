Lesley and David are one of those couples that make even the most hardened cynic’s heart get a little warm and fuzzy. They celebrated their wedding on their seventh anniversary, surrounded by happy family and friends.

Lynda, Lesley’s aunt, was the officiator of the non-religious ceremony, and her words captured Lesley and David’s relationship wonderfully. Helped by Mr Shakespeare’s sonnet, ‘Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediment’, it was a lovely service.

It turns out that winter in Kwa-Zulu Natal is not actually Winter at all. The weather was absolutely beautiful, and played its part perfectly for the sunny outdoor wedding on David’s family’s sugar cane farm.

Lesley was simply beautiful. I’ve been searching for the right phrase to describe how exquisite she looked, but I don’t think that the words actually exist. As she walked down the garden aisle to Bob Dylan’s ‘Make me Feel your Love’, sung by friend Lizzie, everything was just right. Royal blue and yellow were the colours of the day – sunflowers and shweshwe were perfectly joyful.

Lesley’s mother, Penny’s words were powerful and eloquent (as always) and Best Man Paddy had everyone in hysterics. David, however, made it impossible for any man to ever live up to the new standard set for wedding speeches. When he broke out in song (Lou Reed’s ‘Take a Walk on the Wild Side’), accompanied by musician friends in the audience, I think every guest there, including Lesley, was lost for words.

Perhaps it was the full moon, but I think that it was the infectious happiness overflowing that made Lesley and David’s wedding so special. Dancing and merry-making continued long into the clear Zululand night, and I don’t think that any of us guests will remember that day without an enormous smile.

Postscript. bridesmaid and photographer duties were tricky to juggle, but I’m grateful to [Adrian Jennings](http://www.ady-jennings-photography.com) and some delicious Steenberg 1682 MCC, who made it manageable and incredibly fun.
