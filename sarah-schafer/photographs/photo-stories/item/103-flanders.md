Beyond the pommes frites and mayonnaise, politics, beer, waffles and chocolate, Belgium isn’t one of the more celebrated countries in Western Europe – actually, it is probably one of the most vilipended. Perhaps it’s because of the interesting political system, its liberal moral laws or a less-than-perfect colonising history, but whatever the reasoning, the stereotypes miss something big.

From the cosmopolitan and historically rich capital city of Brussels, to the dynamic cultural hub of Antwerp, and the medieval, fairytale-esque streets of Bruges, the Flanders region in Belgium is a wonderful area to visit. A political hotspot in Europe, Flanders is also rich in history and culture.
