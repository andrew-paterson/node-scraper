I am a photographer and writer, based in the magnificent city of Cape Town. I completed a Bachelor of Journalism at Rhodes University, and have been self-employed for the past seven years. 

Documentary photography and reportage will always be my first love, and its influence is clear in my work. When I arrived in Cape Town I was a padawan photography assistant for food photographer extraordinaire [Russel Wasserfall](http://www.rwasserfall.co.za/), who took me under his wing.

I adore natural light, and strive to make the most of light that I'm given. When I shoot personal projects, I prefer shooting on film. Whether it's interiors or architecte; a wedding or a portrait, I aim to create images that are honest and beautiful, taken intuitively and simply. 

I'm currently studying digital curation at the University of Cape Town in the hope of merging my skills in this exciting new field where art and technology collide.
